-- Rollback 0098: drop the pub photo walls and put the tombstone trigger back to
-- migration 0096's shape.
--
-- Dropping the table deletes every wall row. The Storage objects under
-- `venue-photos/` are NOT deleted here: a rollback is a schema decision, and
-- bytes a person uploaded are not something to remove as a side effect of one.
-- Re-applying 0098 on the same bucket therefore finds its objects intact, and a
-- deliberate purge is a separate, explicit operation.
